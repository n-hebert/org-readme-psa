* You can WHAT
Oh my.

Look at that file, fellow [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-moders]]!
That's an .org file! This readme is an Org file!

* Why does [[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes][the manual]] NOT mention this!?

* How is [[https://docs.github.com/en/search?query=readme.org][this search]] blank!?

* Acknowledgements

I would like to shout the heck out of [[https://github.com/xiliuya][xiliuya]] for casually showing this functionality off in [[https://github.com/xiliuya/org-roam-capture-extension/][org-roam-capture-extension]].

This is a game-changer.

Share this to other Org Moders!
